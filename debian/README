The Debian Package grml-rescueboot
==================================

Usually systems are rescued with CD or USB stick. grml-rescueboot makes
it possible to simply copy an Grml ISO image to the harddisk and boot the
rescue image. This eliminates the need to carry around a USB stick
to rescue a system as long as the hard disk and the boot manager still
work.

grml-rescueboot includes the script 42_grml which is installed in
/etc/grub.d and run when update-grub is executed. The script looks for
ISO images in /boot/grml/ and adds an entry for each image found.

Howto
-----

- Get a recent Grml image from http://grml.org/download/
- Copy the image to /boot/grml
- Run update-grub
- Reboot and enjoy your new rescue system

Limitations
-----------

grml-rescueboot uses the loopback feature of GRUB2, so it won't work
with legacy GRUB. Furthermore the ISO image needs to support
loopback.cfg, a file which is placed in /boot/grub/. Grml supports
loopback.cfg beginning with release version 2010.04.

Create your own ISO
-------------------

You can make your own Grml Live ISO image using the grml-live
build framework. Visit http://grml.org/grml-live/ and
